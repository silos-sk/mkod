        Welcome to <strong>My K-dramas on Deck</strong>! Shoutout to K-drama fans out there ^^, <br> <br> 
        This website is created to feature my ever-growing collection of Korean Drama (K-drama) favorites. 
        It has always been quite a feat to keep track of all the K-dramas I have watched. 
        I typically watch a series only once where I engross myself and 'live in the moment' of the storylines. Having watched numerous dramas, these get inevitably piled in the abyss of my thoughts and faintly registers to memory.
        Nonetheless, I have become my social circle's resource on all things K-drama.
        My aim is to create a personal log of the dramas that I have watched including reviews, and feature both ongoing and upcoming series decks for easier recollection and sharing.
        This will also be designed for the enjoyment of people with the same interest or those who just have a general curiosity about which K-dramas to check out. <br>
        <br> My genres of choice are: <em>Romance, Family, Comedy, Action, Music, Slice of Life, Drama, and Historical</em>.

      <p>
        My fascination with Korean dramas started way back during 'Winter Sonata' days. I recall how my whole family used to watch every episode of that series and got so absorbed in the plot. 
        It's amazing how these dramas were made remarkably relatable and realistic.
        I have lost count as to how many series I have watched to date seeing that it has been about 19 years since I started (^.^).
        This website is for me to keep record (for as far as my memory serves me) of all the series I have watched through the years.
        The thing I also love about these dramas is that similar to hearing familiar melodies, I could recall certain periods in my life when I watched them, and reminisce lovingly about the young, naive me.
        I might pour my Korean-mania in this website to include some Korean language and food fancies.

        <h4>Featured Drama of the Week:</h4>
        A Love  So Beautiful (2020)<br>
        <p>I have recently started this adorable series about a young girl who, from her perspective, seems like she has a one-sided crush on the male-lead. This drama brings back memories from my high school days, when life was still all about school, and enjoying time with friends. It also stars a cute cast with charming chemistry too! From the current episode I am watching, it looks like it is a love-triangle kind of story, which always makes me feel so giddy whenever the guys try to win the girlâ€™s heart. I picked this drama because the story seems lighthearted, and enough for a de-stressing session after a long day.</p>

        <h4>Lovestruck in the City [February 2021 - Recently Completed]</h4>
      <em>Synopsis:</em>
        <p>
        This drama is about Lee Eun-ho who went on a hiatus after discovering her fianceâ€™s infidelity. She went on a vacation where she ran away and sought to re-invent herself. On her trip, she met an architect, also on his vacation, named Park Jae-Won who did not know about this guise, and eventually fell in love with the outgoing personality she created as Yoon Seon-a. They both made a connection through Jae-wonâ€™s surfing hobby. They got married in a self-presided ceremony (so not legally) and spent about two months in that wonderful place. Eventually, due to a work issue, Jae-won had to go back to Seoul, and they both decided to meet up there at a specific time and place. When Lee Eun-ho went back to Seoul, she felt scared about revealing the truth to Jae-won so she decided not to show up and left him a voicemail instead, saying that he should just forget her, and that she is keeping Jae-wonâ€™s camera as a souvenir. That camera was very precious to Jae-won and it was where their pictures from that trip were captured. 
        <br><br>
          Jae-won waited for her a couple of times on that place where they arranged to meet though she did not appear. It turned out that Jae-wonâ€™s cousin was in Eun-hoâ€™s circle of friends and this made her feel even more scared of revealing to both her friends and Jae-won about why she did what she did. Long story short, Jae-won learned about this, got angry at first but still loved her, understood her circumstance, and when Eun-ho finally accepted herself, and Jae-wonâ€™s feelings, they both reconciled and went back to being lovers. The story also mentioned about the dating lives of Eun-hoâ€™s friends Rin-yi + Kyung-joon, and Kang Geon + Sun-young. Each of them responded to questions like in a mockumentary format about love and dating throughout the story.
        
      </p>
      <em>My Rating:</em> &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; (4/5)<br><br>
      <h5>Story:</h5> This drama started strong, with a storyline that is quite unique where characters are talking to a fictional interviewer and talking about their views about love. I liked the touch of mystery and how it slowly unfolded on why Lee Eun-ho ended up going in that vacation in the first place. There were also other love teams in the story which made it relatable and gave me the feeling like I am inside the story, and I am one of the friends. The episodes towards the ending though feel a bit short and made me long for more.
      <br>
      <h5>Cast/Characters:</h5> I absolutely love Ji Chang-Wook and Kim Ji-Wonâ€™s chemistry in this drama. I could not get enough of the scene when Park Jae Won was serenading Yoon Seon-a by the payphone! The cast was well chosen, and I feel that they all measured up to their roles.
      <br>
      <h5>Soundtrack:</h5> The drama has many feel-good songs which fit the storyline well. 
      <br>
      <h5>Setting:</h5> The experience of a vacation and city life were depicted perfectly as if it can be truly someone elseâ€™s story. The videography of the scenes was beautifully executed, and the story was told in a natural, matter-of-fact way.
      <br>
      <h5>Impact:</h5> This drama was an emotional rollercoaster for me, and I was relentlessly invested in Yoon Seon-a/Lee Un-hoâ€™s heartbreak. I felt like I could identify with her wanting to escape her â€˜oldâ€™ self and reinvent a more outgoing personality. Overall, it gave me the feel-good vibe and I had to watch this in a marathon session.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>My K-dramas on Deck</strong>! Shoutout to K-drama fans out there ^^, <br> <br> 
        This website is created to feature my ever-growing collection of Korean Drama (K-drama) favorites. 
        It has always been quite a feat to keep track of all the K-dramas I have watched. 
        I typically watch a series only once where I engross myself and 'live in the moment' of the storylines. Having watched numerous dramas, these get inevitably piled in the abyss of my thoughts and faintly registers to memory.
        Nonetheless, I have become my social circle's resource on all things K-drama.
        My aim is to create a personal log of the dramas that I have watched including reviews, and feature both ongoing and upcoming series decks for easier recollection and sharing.
        This will also be designed for the enjoyment of people with the same interest or those who just have a general curiosity about which K-dramas to check out. <br>
        <br> My genres of choice are: <em>Romance, Family, Comedy, Action, Music, Slice of Life, Drama, and Historical</em>.
